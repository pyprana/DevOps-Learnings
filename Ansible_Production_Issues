Ansible Production Issues
1. Connectivity Issues
- UNREACHABLE! errors, timeout issues, or SSH failures.
- Causes: Network issues, incorrect SSH keys, or unreachable hosts.
Solutions:
- Verify inventory file IPs/hostnames.
- Ensure SSH keys are correctly configured (ssh-add may be needed).
- Use ansible -m ping all to test connectivity.
- Adjust ansible_ssh_common_args for custom SSH settings.

2. Authentication Problems
- Permission denied or sudo password errors.
- Causes: Incorrect user permissions, missing sudo configuration.
Solutions:
- Use become: yes or become_method: sudo.
- Add proper sudo permissions in /etc/sudoers.
- Set ansible_become_password securely using ansible-vault.

3. Playbook Failures Due to Idempotency Issues
- Tasks running repeatedly despite desired state already being achieved.
- Causes: Incorrect when conditions or missing changed_when.
Solutions:
- Ensure all tasks are idempotent.
- Use check_mode: yes to test idempotency.

4. Variable and Fact Issues
- Incorrect variable values, undefined variable errors.
Causes: Variable scope confusion or missing facts.
Solutions:
- Use ansible-playbook -e to pass extra vars.
- Ensure gather_facts: yes is enabled in playbooks.
- Check variable precedence carefully.

5. Module Dependency Issues
- Specific Ansible modules fail during execution.
Causes: Missing Python libraries or incompatible module versions.
Solutions:
- Run ansible -m setup to gather system details.
- Ensure dependent Python packages are installed.
- For missing libraries, use pip install <package>.

6. Performance Problems
- Slow playbook execution or resource exhaustion.
Causes: Inefficient looping, redundant tasks, or lack of parallelism.
Solutions:
- Use forks in ansible.cfg to increase parallel execution.
- Avoid redundant register variables unless necessary.
- Use async and poll for long-running tasks.

7. Inventory Management Challenges
- Hosts missing from the playbook execution.
Causes: Incorrect inventory paths or syntax errors.
Solutions:
- Use ansible-inventory --list to validate inventory files.
- Maintain dynamic inventory scripts for cloud environments.

8. Configuration Drift
- Servers diverge from expected configurations over time.
Causes: Manual changes outside Ansible or non-idempotent tasks.
Solutions:
- Regularly run Ansible for state enforcement.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated enforcement.

9. Secret Management Issues
- Credentials exposed in playbooks or logs.
Causes: Hardcoded secrets or poor security practices.
Solutions:
- Use ansible-vault for sensitive data.
- Integrate with secure vault systems like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

10. YAML Syntax Errors
- Playbooks failing to parse correctly.
Causes: Indentation issues or incorrect YAML structure.
Solutions:
- Use ansible-lint to validate syntax.
- Follow consistent indentation and syntax practices.
