Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy, a server positioned in front of backend servers, directs client requests to them efficiently.
- Facilitates load balancing.
- Enables SSL termination.
- Enhances caching mechanisms.
- Provides security by concealing the backend structure.
- Supports centralized authentication.

Ideal for:
- High-traffic applications.
- Distributing content from various servers.
- Establishing an API gateway.

Used in front of:
- Web servers.
- App servers.
- APIs (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, Apache).

- Example:
- Upon a client requesting abcd.com, Nginx intervenes, directing the request to one of multiple backend servers.
