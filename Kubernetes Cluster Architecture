Kubernetes Cluster Architecture – Quick Guide for DevOps Engineers
A Kubernetes Cluster = Control Plane + Worker Nodes
Here's how it all fits together ↓
Control Plane – Brain of the cluster:
kube-apiserver: API entry
etcd: Stores all configs/state
kube-scheduler: Assigns Pods
kube-controller-manager: Runs background checks
cloud-controller-manager: Manages cloud integration

Node Components – Where your apps live:
kubelet: Runs your Pods
kube-proxy: Routes traffic
containerd or CRI-O: Executes containers

Add-ons:
DNS, Monitoring, Dashboard, CNI plugins

Deployment Models:
Static | Self-hosted | Managed (EKS/GKE/AKS)

Why It Matters:
Modular
Scalable
Resilient
