- What:
- Incident Manager is the primary point of coordination during a major incident (e.g., outages, system failures), ensuring rapid recovery and minimal impact.

- When:
- Activated during P1/P0 incidents, service outages, data breaches, or performance degradations.

- Where:
- Used in production environments, cloud platforms, enterprise infrastructure, or customer-facing systems.

- Why:
- To ensure:

- Timely response

- Clear communication

- Root cause analysis (RCA)

- Postmortems & continuous improvement

- How (Responsibilities):
- Acknowledge incident, classify severity (P1â€“P4)

- Assemble response team (eng, QA, comms)

- Communicate updates (Slack, StatusPage, Email)

- Track timeline, mitigation, resolution

- Initiate RCA, create post-incident report

- Example:
- During an AWS outage, the Incident Manager:

- Initiates war room

- Coordinates with AWS support and internal teams

- Sends hourly updates

- Oversees service restoration

- Use Case:
- Used in SaaS companies, banks, e-commerce, and telecom during downtime to restore SLAs quickly.

What:
Incident Management is the structured process to detect, respond, resolve, and learn from service disruptions or system failures.

ðŸ”¹ Why:
Minimize downtime (MTTR)

Maintain SLAs/SLOs

Ensure customer trust and service reliability

Enable root cause identification and prevention

ðŸ”¹ When:
Triggered during:

Outages (P0/P1)

Performance issues

Security breaches

Infrastructure/resource failures

ðŸ”¹ Where:
Applied in:

Production environments

Cloud & on-prem systems

Monitoring/alerting tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)

Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams)

ðŸ”¹ How (Lifecycle Steps):
Detection: Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch) trigger alerts

Triage: Incident classified (P0â€“P4)

Response: On-call engineer or Incident Manager assigned

Mitigation: Temporary fix or rollback

Resolution: Full recovery and fix

Postmortem: RCA + action items to avoid recurrence

ðŸ”¹ Example:
An API latency spike triggers an alert via Grafana â†’ PagerDuty notifies on-call SRE â†’ IM coordinates rollback of last deployment â†’ Latency stabilizes â†’ Postmortem conducted.

ðŸ”¹ Production Tools:
Alerting: Prometheus, CloudWatch, New Relic

On-Call Mgmt: PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps

Incident Tracking: Jira, ServiceNow, Statuspage

Collaboration: Slack, Zoom, Google Meet
