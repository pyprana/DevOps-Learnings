- RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are web services that follow REST architecture principles.

- What:
- A RESTful API allows systems to communicate over HTTP using standard methods like:

- GET – Retrieve data

- POST – Create data

- PUT – Update data

- DELETE – Remove data

- Why:
- Simple, stateless communication

- Scalable and easily consumed

- Uses standard HTTP protocols

- When:
- Use REST when:

- You need simple CRUD operations

- Interacting over the web (e.g., web apps, mobile apps)

- Where:
- Widely used in web services (e.g., Twitter API, GitHub API)

- Backend systems for frontend applications

- Example (JSON-based):
- http

- GET /users/123
- Response: { "id": 123, "name": "Alice" }
