- System(Application + Infrastructure) - App + Networking - Observability.
- State of the application.
- Failures you can understand.
- State of your infrastructure.
- State of Networking.
- Latency.
- Http Traffic.
- Disk utilization of a particular node on my kubernetes cluster over the last 24 hours.
- CPU utilization of a prticular node of the Kubernetes Cluster.
- Memory Utlization.
- Out of 100 Http Requests or out of 100 API calls that are made to the application, How many are successful.What are the number of requests that were failure.
- State of the system like 
i.) Disk Utilization.
ii.) CPU Utlization.
iii.) Memory Utilization.
iv.) Even the number of requests that are failed or passed.
- Observaility doesnt stop there it will also help you understand why is your system in that state, but it will help you understad why its in a particular state.
- Lets say there are 100 http requests, in that why 5 requests are failed what is the reason for it, which part of the applicatin the request is failing what is the reason for it.
In which part of the application the request is failing you can get the complete information about the faiure and also understand why is there a memory leak by a particular app.
