1. What is AWS DMS?
- AWS Database Migration Service helps migrate databases quickly and securely to AWS, with minimal downtime.

2. Key Concepts
a. Source & Target Endpoints
- What: Define where data comes from and goes to.
- Example: Source = On-prem Oracle; Target = Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.

b. Replication Instance
- What: EC2-like instance that runs the replication tasks.
- Where: In a VPC with network access to source and target.
- Why: It handles the actual data migration process.

c. Migration Task Types
- Types:
- Full Load
- CDC (Change Data Capture)
- Full Load + CDC
- When:
- Full Load: One-time bulk.
- CDC: Ongoing sync (real-time changes).
- Example: Migrate a live database with minimal downtime → Use Full Load + CDC.

d. Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
- What: Converts schema from one DB engine to another.
- Use: Required for heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL).
- Why: Schema differences need conversion before data is moved.

e. Table Mapping Rules
- What: Controls which tables or columns are included/excluded.
- Use Case: Only migrate selected schemas or columns.

f. Data Transformation Rules
- What: Modify data during migration (e.g., rename columns, mask data).
- Example: Rename a column from ssn to encrypted_ssn.

g. Validation & Monitoring
- Tools: CloudWatch logs, DMS console, validation reports.

- Why: Track progress, errors, throughput, latency.

h. Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Migration
Type	          Tools Needed	    Example
Homogeneous	    DMS only	        MySQL → RDS MySQL
Heterogeneous	  SCT + DMS	        Oracle → Amazon Aurora

i. Who Uses AWS DMS?
- DBAs
- Cloud Migration Engineers
- DevOps teams during cloud adoption

j. When to Use AWS DMS?
- On-prem to cloud DB migration
- Cross-region replication
- DB engine upgrade
- Live migration with minimal downtime

k. Where It Fits in Architecture
- Used during cloud migration
- Part of hybrid or multi-cloud strategies
- Combined with Data Lakes for ingestion

- Why Use AWS DMS?
- No downtime

- Supports major DB engines

- Scales with replication instances

- CDC ensures real-time sync

- Supported DB Engines
- Source & Target Examples:

- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift

- Example Use Case
- Scenario: Migrate on-prem Oracle to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with zero downtime.

- Steps:

- Use SCT to convert schema

- Create replication instance

- Configure source and target endpoints

- Create task with Full Load + CDC

- Monitor and validate migration

- Production Best Practices
- Use Multi-AZ replication instance

- Enable logging and alerts

- Run data validation

- Monitor CDC lag for real-time migration
