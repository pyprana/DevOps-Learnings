Best Security Practices for Production Kubernetes Clusters:
1. RBAC (Access Control)
- Give users only the access they need.
- Don’t give apps full admin access.
- Set access rules for each team or project.

2. Network Policies
- Block all network traffic by default.
- Allow only what’s needed between apps.
- Use tools like Calico or Cilium to enforce it.

3. Pod Security
- Follow strict rules for running pods safely.
- Don’t allow containers to run with full system access.
- Run containers as regular users, not as root.
- Make the container’s file system read-only if possible.

4. Secrets Management
- Store sensitive info like passwords in secure tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Don’t use ConfigMaps for secrets.
- Turn on encryption to protect secrets.

5. Image Security
- Use images from safe, trusted places.
- Check images for security issues using tools like Trivy.
- Lock images to specific versions.

6. Logging & Monitoring
- Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the system.
- Collect logs with ELK, EFK, or Loki.
- Use Falco to watch for suspicious activity.

7. Audit Logging
- Turn on logs that track who does what in the cluster.
- Look out for strange or risky actions.

8. Authentication
- Use secure logins like single sign-on (SSO).
- Change access tokens and certificates often.

9. API Server Exposure
- Keep the API server private.
- Use a firewall to control access.
- Protect Ingress traffic with login or other checks.

10. Cluster Maintenance
- Keep Kubernetes up to date
- Apply security updates quickly
- Back up the main database (etcd) often
