4. Log Monitoring
Tools: Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus (with logging plugins)
Purpose: Real-time alerting and anomaly detection.

5. Log Management Platforms (All-in-One)
Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana), Graylog, Splunk, Sumo Logic
Purpose: Provide end-to-end solutions for log collection, storage, analysis, and monitoring.

-Whether it's for debugging, compliance, or system optimization â€” proper log management is non-negotiable!
