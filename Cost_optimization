- Cost Optimization means reducing spending while maintaining performance.
✅ Ways to do it:
- Right-sizing: Use only the resources you need (e.g., smaller EC2 instances).

- Auto-scaling: Scale up/down automatically based on demand.
- Reserved Instances/Savings Plans: Commit usage for 1–3 years for big discounts (AWS, Azure, GCP).

- Spot Instances/Preemptible VMs: Use cheap, short-term resources for non-critical workloads.

- Turn off Idle Resources: Shut down VMs, databases, or clusters when not in use.

- Storage Management:
- Archive infrequent data (e.g., AWS Glacier, Azure Cool Blob).
- Delete unused snapshots, volumes.

- Optimize Networking:
- Reduce data transfer costs (e.g., use CloudFront, CDN).

- Optimize Licensing:
- Bring Your Own License (BYOL) where possible.

- Monitoring & Alerts:
- Tools like AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Advisor, GCP Billing reports help detect wastage early.

- Containerization & Serverless:
- Use Kubernetes or AWS Lambda to pay only for actual usage.
