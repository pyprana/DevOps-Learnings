- MySQL in DevOps is primarily used as a database to store and manage application data during the development, testing, and production lifecycle. Here's how it helps:
- Use of MySQL in DevOps:
- Application Data Storage:
- MySQL stores structured data like user info, transactions, logs, etc.

- CI/CD Integration:
- MySQL is used in pipelines to create, migrate, or seed databases during automated testing/deployments.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- DevOps uses tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Docker to provision and configure MySQL automatically.

- Monitoring & Backups:
- DevOps teams automate health checks, backups, and replication for MySQL in production.

- Rollback & Recovery:
- MySQL snapshots help in quick rollbacks during faulty deployments.

- Containerization:
- MySQL runs as a Docker container for isolated testing and consistent environments.

- How would you migrate an on-prem Java + MySQL application to AWS?
- Provision infrastructure using EC2 or ECS to run the Java application.
- Set up RDS (MySQL) or EC2-hosted MySQL as the backend.
- Use Terraform or CloudFormation for infra automation.
- Configure Maven and Java environments on build agents for deployment.
- Use Jenkins pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment.
- Enable CloudWatch for monitoring, ELB for load balancing.
