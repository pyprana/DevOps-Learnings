MySQL in DevOps is primarily used as a database to store and manage application data during the development, testing, and production lifecycle. Here's how it helps:
- Use of MySQL in DevOps:
Application Data Storage:
MySQL stores structured data like user info, transactions, logs, etc.

CI/CD Integration:
MySQL is used in pipelines to create, migrate, or seed databases during automated testing/deployments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
DevOps uses tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Docker to provision and configure MySQL automatically.

Monitoring & Backups:
DevOps teams automate health checks, backups, and replication for MySQL in production.

Rollback & Recovery:
MySQL snapshots help in quick rollbacks during faulty deployments.

Containerization:
MySQL runs as a Docker container for isolated testing and consistent environments.
