- Vault (by HashiCorp) is a tool for secrets management, encryption, and identity-based access to systems and data.

- What is Vault?
- A security tool to store, access, and tightly control secrets like API keys, passwords, certificates, and tokens.

- Key Features:
- Secret Storage (KV store)

- Dynamic Secrets (e.g., generate AWS creds on demand)

- Encryption as a Service (encrypt/decrypt data without storing it)

- Identity-based Access (policy-controlled access via tokens, IAM, etc.)

- Audit Logs (for tracking access)

- Use Cases:
- Store and rotate database passwords securely.

- Provide temporary AWS credentials to CI/CD pipelines.

- Encrypt sensitive app data using Vault's transit engine.

- Manage PKI and TLS certificates.

- Components:
- Secrets Engines (e.g., KV, AWS, Database)

- Authentication Methods (e.g., AppRole, GitHub, AWS IAM)

- Policies (written in HCL to manage access)

- Audit Devices (for security logs)

- CLI Example:
- vault kv put secret/db username=admin password=pass123
- vault kv get secret/db

- Deployment:
- Runs as a server (standalone or HA with storage backends like Consul, S3, etc.)

- Requires unsealing at startup with unseal keys.
