- A Landing Zone serves as a secure, standard, and scalable foundation for deploying cloud workloads across platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. 
- It enforces default security, compliance, and governance measures, standardizes cloud environment setup, facilitates a multi-account approach (e.g., dev, test, prod), and 
ensures consistent and scalable cloud adoption.

- This structured environment is crucial at the onset of cloud migration or adoption, when secure and scalable setups are needed, or when managing various teams, accounts, or 
workloads. 

- Landing Zones are commonly utilized in AWS Control Tower, Azure Landing Zones (CAF), and Google Cloud Landing Zone, typically implemented through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 
tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

- In AWS, for instance, AWS Control Tower is utilized to establish a landing zone, configuring core accounts such as Audit, Log Archive, Security, and Shared Services. 
- This setup includes applying Service Control Policies (SCPs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), logging mechanisms, and monitoring protocols.

- Compared to a typical account setup, Landing Zones offer pre-configured security and governance measures enforced centrally, a multi-account structure following best practices,
- IaC-based automation for repeatability, and centralized monitoring through logging and compliance tools, ensuring standardized practices across the board.
