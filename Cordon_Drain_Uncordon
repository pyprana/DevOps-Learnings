 Cordon means marking a node as unschedulable, so no new pods are scheduled on it.
- It prevents new pods from being scheduled, but existing pods keep running.
- Command - kubectl cordon <node-name>

Why:
- For maintenance, troubleshooting, or decommissioning a node without affecting running workloads.

When:
- Before draining or rebooting a node.

Where:
- Used in Kubernetes cluster node management.
Example: kubectl cordon worker-node-1

Cordon
- Marks a node as unschedulable.
- No new pods will be scheduled.
- Existing pods keep running.
- Used before maintenance or debugging.
- Command - kubectl cordon <node-name>

Use Cases for cordon
- Preparing a node for maintenance (e.g., OS patch, disk cleanup).
- Preventing new workloads during performance issues.
- Staging node replacement without disrupting current pods.
- Debugging a node without affecting existing running pods.

AWS EKS – Use Case - cordon
- Before running SSM Patch Manager on EC2 nodes.
- Pausing pod scheduling during ENI/network issue debugging.

drain
- Evicts all pods from the node.
- Also cordons the node.
- Skips DaemonSet pods by default.
- Deletes emptyDir data (unless configured otherwise).
- Used before shutdown, scaling, or updates.
- Command - kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

drain Use Cases
- Safely rebooting or shutting down a node.
- Rolling update of Kubernetes nodes (e.g., AMI upgrade in EKS).
- Node autoscaling (scale-in): remove workloads cleanly.
- Decommissioning or replacing a node.
- Moving pods during a zone outage simulation or chaos testing.

drain AWS EKS – Use Case
- During Auto Scaling Group (ASG) rolling updates using new AMI.
- Pre-stop hook in spot instance termination lifecycle to drain pods.
- Evicting pods before resizing instance types (e.g., t3.medium → m5.large).

uncordon
- Makes a node schedulable again.
- Allows new pods to be scheduled.
- Used after maintenance.
- Command: kubectl uncordon <node-name>

uncordon Use Cases
- Bringing a node back into production after maintenance.
- Rejoining the node to the pool after draining and validation.
- Rebalancing workloads across available nodes.

uncordon
- After completing EBS volume expansion and node reboot.
- Post-maintenance (e.g., after upgrading kubelet).
