CloudWatch Scenario-Based Use Cases

1. EC2 CPU Spike Alert
 • What: CPU usage went above 85% for 5 mins.
 • Why: App under sudden load.
 • Action: CloudWatch alarm triggered -> SNS -> DevOps team notified.
 • Fix: Auto Scaling Group increased instances.

2. Memory Utilization Missing
 • What: Team needed memory metrics on EC2.
 • Why: By default, CloudWatch doesn’t capture memory.
 • Action: Installed CloudWatch Agent with custom config.
 • Fix: Memory + disk usage now visible in dashboards.

3. Application Error Rate Monitoring
 • What: App logs showed high 5xx errors.
 • Why: Bug in recent deployment.
 • Action: CloudWatch Logs + Metric Filter + Alarm on error count.
 • Fix: Auto rollback triggered using Lambda.

4. S3 Access Pattern Alert
 • What: Sudden spike in S3 GET requests.
 • Why: Suspicious script or DDoS.
 • Action: CloudWatch + CloudTrail integration.
 • Fix: Blocked IP via WAF, alerted security team.

- S3 GET requests
- A GET request downloads an object using its bucket name and object key.

- Example:
bash
- aws s3api get-object --bucket my-bucket --key myfile.txt myfile.txt
Or using SDK (Python Boto3):

python
- s3.download_file('my-bucket', 'myfile.txt', 'myfile.txt')

- Use Cases:
- Download backups or logs.

- Serve images/videos to users.

- Fetch static files for apps or websites.

- Notes:
- Charges apply per GET request and data transfer.

- Can use presigned URLs for secure access without credentials.

5. Cost Optimization with Custom Metrics
 • What: Need to monitor EBS burst balance and optimize cost.
 • Why: Burst credits exhausted, I/O throttling.
 • Action: Custom dashboard + alert on low burst balance.
 • Fix: Moved to gp3 volume to avoid credit limits.
