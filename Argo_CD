- Argo CD is an open-source, declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. 
- It automates application deployment by syncing the desired state from a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster. Argo CD continuously monitors Git repositories and compares the actual cluster state to the declared configuration. When differences are detected, it can alert users or automatically apply changes to bring the system into the desired state.
