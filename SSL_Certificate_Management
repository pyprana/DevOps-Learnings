For public websites, internal services, APIs, load balancers, etc.

During certificate expiry/rotation, renewals, and infrastructure changes

Buy from CA (DigiCert, GoDaddy) or use free ones (Let's Encrypt)

Installation

Configure cert/key pair in Nginx, Apache, ELB, etc.

Renewal

Manual or automated (cron, Certbot, AWS ACM auto-renew)

Monitoring

Track expiry with tools like Nagios, Prometheus + Alertmanager, or custom scripts

Rotation

Replace before expiry or on compromise

Revocation

Invalidate via CRL/OCSP if compromised
