1. ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- What: Fully managed container orchestration service by AWS.
- When: When you want to run containers in AWS without managing Kubernetes.
- Where: Runs on EC2 or Fargate in AWS regions.
- Why: Simplifies container management; deeply integrates with IAM, ALB, ECR, etc.
- Example: Running a containerized Node.js app using ECS on Fargate.
- Use Case: Microservices, batch jobs, REST APIs.
- Production Use: Autoscaling API containers behind ALB using ECS + Fargate.
- Difference: Compared to EKS, ECS is AWS-native and simpler to set up.

2. ECS Cluster
- What: Logical grouping of tasks or services.
- Why: Organizes and isolates workloads.
- Where: You define it in the ECS console or CLI.
- Use Case: One cluster per environment (dev, staging, prod).

3. Task Definition
- What: JSON blueprint that defines containers, CPU, memory, ports, IAM, etc.
- Why: Reusable config for launching tasks.
- Example: Task def for Python app with Redis sidecar.
- Use Case: Version-controlled container specs.

4. Task
- What: An instance of a Task Definition.
- When: Launched on-demand or via services.
- Use Case: Run single-use container jobs.

5. Service
- What: Long-running group of tasks managed together.
- Why: Handles task scaling, health checks, restarts.
- Use Case: Keeps 3 replicas of your web container running.
- Example: ECS service with ALB target group.

6. Launch Types
| Type    | What                             | Use Case                |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| EC2     | Runs containers on EC2 instances | Full control over infra |
| Fargate | Serverless container engine      | No infra management     |

7. Container Definitions
- What: Part of the Task Definition – image, env vars, memory, CPU, ports.
- Why: Defines each container’s behavior.

8. ECS Service Discovery
- What: Internal DNS resolution for containers via Route 53.
- Use Case: Container-to-container communication.

9. ECS Load Balancing
- What: Supports ALB, NLB, or CLB for incoming traffic.
- Why: Routes requests to containers dynamically.

10. ECS Auto Scaling
- What: Adjusts task count based on metrics (CPU, memory, custom).
- Why: Cost-effective and resilient applications.

11. ECS Logging (CloudWatch)
- What: Logs from containers streamed to CloudWatch Logs.
- Why: For monitoring and debugging containers.

12. ECS Capacity Provider
- What: Controls how ECS launches tasks (Fargate vs EC2, spot vs on-demand).
- Use Case: Cost optimization using EC2 Spot.

13. ECS Blue/Green Deployments (via CodeDeploy)
- What: Safer deployments with traffic shifting.
- When: Needed during updates with zero downtime.

14. ECS Integration with CI/CD
- Tools: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions.
- Why: Automate ECS deployments with zero manual steps.
