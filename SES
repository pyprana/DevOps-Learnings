Transactional: User-triggered emails (e.g., order confirmation)

Promotional: Marketing, bulk emails

Notification: Alerts, status updates

B. Identity Management
Email identity: Verify individual email addresses

Domain identity: Verify entire domain (DKIM/SPF required)

Verification methods: Email, DNS (TXT, CNAME)

C. SMTP Interface
Use standard SMTP protocol to send email via SES

Requires SMTP username/password (generated from IAM)

D. API Interface
RESTful API via AWS SDK or CLI (e.g., sendEmail, sendRawEmail)

E. Email Sending Limits
Depends on region & verification

Includes sending quota and sending rate (e.g., 50,000 emails/day)

F. Dedicated IPs (Optional)
For consistent reputation & deliverability

Costs extra
