- Software Upgrade Activities
- Version Compatibility Check:
- Confirm that the new software version is compatible with OS, database, middleware, and application components.

- Pre-Upgrade Backup:
- Take complete backups or snapshots of the application, databases, and configurations to ensure rollback capability.

- Change Management and Approval:
- Raise a change request and get approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB) before proceeding.

- Maintenance Window Planning:
- Schedule the upgrade during a low-traffic period to minimize user impact, often late nights or weekends.

- Upgrade Execution:
- Deploy the new software version using automated or manual steps depending on the system setup.

- Sanity and Smoke Testing:
- Post-upgrade, quickly verify key functionality (UI, APIs, logins, database connectivity) to ensure the system is operational.

- Monitoring and Logs Validation:
- Check logs and monitor system metrics like CPU, memory, and application errors to detect issues early.

- Rollback Plan Execution (if needed):
- If any major issues are found, revert to the previous working state using the backup or snapshot.

- Hardware Upgrade Activities
- Assessment and Capacity Planning:
- Identify performance bottlenecks or capacity issues (CPU, RAM, disk, network) that justify a hardware upgrade.

- Procurement and Setup:
- Order new hardware and physically install it in the data center or integrate new cloud resources.

- Firmware and BIOS Update:
- Upgrade the firmware or BIOS on the new hardware to ensure stability and compatibility.

- Configuration and Integration:
- Set up operating systems, network configurations, and monitoring agents on the new hardware.

- Data Migration:
- Transfer data from old systems using cloning, rsync, or database replication techniques.

- Validation and Testing:
- Perform system validation to confirm that hardware is working as expected (network, disk I/O, application behavior).

- Cutover to New Hardware:
- Redirect traffic or workloads to the upgraded hardware using DNS changes, load balancers, or switchover scripts.

- Decommission Old Systems (if required):
- Once new systems are stable, safely retire the older hardware after wiping sensitive data.
