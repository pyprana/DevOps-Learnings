- ELK Stack (Technology):
- The ELK Stack is a suite of open-source software tools used for log management and analysis. 
- It comprises Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 

- Elasticsearch: A distributed, schema-free search and analytics engine that stores and indexes data. 

- Logstash: A tool for collecting, processing, and forwarding data from various sources. 

- Kibana: A web interface for visualizing and analyzing data within Elasticsearch. 
- The ELK Stack is used for tasks like application monitoring, security analysis, and infrastructure troubleshooting. 
- It's commonly used in cloud and hybrid environments to manage and analyze data effectively. 

- What is the ELK Stack?
- ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source tools: 
- Elasticsearch, 
- Logstash, and
- Kibana, 
- Used for centralized logging, data analysis, and visualization.

- Elasticsearch: Search and analytics engine.
- Logstash: Data collection and transformation pipeline.
- Kibana: Visualization and dashboard interface.

- Why is the ELK Stack popular?
- Centralized logging for better monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Scalable and real-time analytics.
- Open-source and cost-effective.

- Explain the architecture of the ELK Stack.
- Logstash collects and processes data.
- Elasticsearch stores and indexes the processed data.
- Kibana visualizes the data using dashboards.

- What is Elasticsearch?
- It’s a distributed search engine based on Lucene that supports full-text search and analytics on large datasets.

- What is Logstash?
- A data pipeline tool used to collect, process, and forward data into Elasticsearch or other outputs.

- What is Kibana?
- A visualization tool for Elasticsearch data. It allows users to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.

- What are some use cases of the ELK Stack?
- Log analysis and monitoring.
- Application performance monitoring (APM).
- Security and compliance.
- Business intelligence and analytics.

- What is the difference between ELK and EFK?
- EFK Stack replaces Logstash with Fluentd, which is lighter and more resource-efficient.

- What are Beats in the ELK ecosystem?
- Beats are lightweight data shippers that send data directly to Elasticsearch or Logstash. Examples include Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Packetbeat.

- What is the purpose of Filebeat?
- It collects log files and forwards them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

- What is an Elasticsearch index?
- An index is a collection of documents in Elasticsearch. It’s similar to a database in relational systems.

- What is a document in Elasticsearch?
- A document is the basic unit of data, stored in JSON format.

- Explain Elasticsearch shards.
- Shards split an index into smaller parts to distribute and process data across multiple nodes.

- What are replicas in Elasticsearch?
- Replicas are copies of primary shards used for fault tolerance and load balancing.

- How does Elasticsearch handle full-text search?
- Elasticsearch uses the Inverted Index data structure and Lucene Query for full-text search.

- What are Elasticsearch analyzers?
- Analyzers process text data for indexing and searching. Examples: standard, whitespace, and custom analyzers.

- What is a query DSL in Elasticsearch?
- Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is used to write queries, such as match, term, or range.

- How does Elasticsearch differ from traditional databases?
- It is schema-free, supports distributed architecture, and excels in full-text search.

- What is a mapping in Elasticsearch?
- Mapping defines how a document’s fields are stored and indexed.

- What is the purpose of Elasticsearch aggregations?
- Aggregations allow advanced analytics, such as data summarization and statistical calculations.

- What are Logstash pipelines?
- A pipeline is a sequence of stages: input, filter, and output, used to process data.

- What is the purpose of the Logstash config file?
- The config file defines input sources, filters, and output destinations.

- What are Logstash plugins?
- Plugins are modular components in Logstash:
- Input Plugins: Fetch data (e.g., file, beats).
- Filter Plugins: Process data (e.g., grok, mutate).
- Output Plugins: Send data (e.g., elasticsearch, stdout).

- What is the grok filter in Logstash?
- Grok filters parse unstructured data into structured data using predefined patterns.

- How do you monitor Logstash performance?
- Use monitoring APIs, log files, and pipeline metrics in Kibana.

- How does Logstash handle failures?
- It retries events and uses a dead letter queue for failed events.

- What is a multiline filter in Logstash?
- It combines multiple log lines into a single event, often used for stack traces.

- What is the use of conditionals in Logstash pipelines?
- Conditionals apply filters or outputs based on specific criteria.

- Can Logstash output to multiple destinations?
- Yes, it supports multiple outputs like Elasticsearch, S3, and Kafka.

- How do you secure Logstash?
- Use SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and pipeline-specific access controls.

- What is Kibana used for?
- It visualizes Elasticsearch data with charts, maps, and dashboards.

- How do you create a dashboard in Kibana?
- Use visualizations (e.g., bar charts, tables) and combine them into a dashboard.

- What are index patterns in Kibana?
- Index patterns connect Kibana to specific Elasticsearch indices.

- What is the Discover tab in Kibana?
- It provides a raw view of Elasticsearch data with search and filter capabilities.

- What is Kibana Lens?
- A user-friendly interface for creating visualizations with drag-and-drop functionality.

- How can you secure Kibana?
- Use role-based access control, TLS encryption, and secure Elasticsearch integration.

- What is Canvas in Kibana?
- A tool for creating custom, infographic-style visualizations and reports.

- What are Kibana alerts?
- Alerts notify users about data changes based on defined conditions.

- What is Kibana Timelion?
- A tool for time-series visualizations and analysis.

- Can you embed Kibana visualizations into external applications?
- Yes, using iframe links or APIs.

- How do you scale the ELK Stack?
- Scale Elasticsearch with more nodes and shards, use Kafka with Logstash for high-volume data, and implement Kibana load balancing.

- What is X-Pack in Elasticsearch?
- A plugin offering features like security, monitoring, and machine learning.

- What is the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)?
- A standard schema for structured logging across the ELK ecosystem.

- How does Elasticsearch ensure data consistency?
- By using write-ahead logging (WAL) and primary-replica synchronization.

- How can you optimize Elasticsearch queries?
- Use filters instead of queries, minimize wildcard usage, and ensure proper indexing.

- What is hot-warm architecture in Elasticsearch?
- A tiered storage approach where hot nodes handle frequent queries, and warm nodes store older data.

- How do you back up Elasticsearch data?
- Use the snapshot and restore feature to store data in repositories like S3.

- What are common performance bottlenecks in ELK?
- High CPU usage in Logstash, insufficient heap size in Elasticsearch, and slow Kibana visualizations.

- How do you secure the entire ELK Stack?
- Use authentication, encryption, role-based access, and network isolation.
