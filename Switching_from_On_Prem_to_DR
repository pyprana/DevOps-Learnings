- What is the process to switch on from on prem to dr and vice versa?
- Switching from on-prem to Disaster Recovery (DR) site and back involves a structured failover and failback process:

✅ 1. Failover: On-Prem ➜ DR Site
- What it means: Redirecting workloads from the primary (on-prem) to the DR site due to failure or planned maintenance.

- Steps:
- Trigger DR Plan – Due to outage, maintenance, or disaster.

- Notify Stakeholders – Inform teams and users.

- Check DR Readiness – Ensure DR site VMs, DBs, services are up-to-date.

- DNS/Route Switch – Update DNS, Load Balancer, or BGP routes to point to DR.

- Start Critical Services – Apps, DBs, monitoring tools.

- Verify Functionality – Run health checks and smoke tests.

- Log Everything – Audit trail for future reference.

2. Failback: DR Site ➜ On-Prem
- What it means: Restoring services back to the original on-prem site once it's stable.

- Steps:
- Confirm On-Prem Recovery – Ensure infrastructure is restored.
- Sync Data – Replicate updated data from DR to on-prem.
- Prepare Systems – Restart apps, databases, configs on on-prem.
- Switch DNS/Routes Back – Point traffic back to on-prem.
- Run Smoke Tests – Validate functionality post-failback.

- Deactivate DR – Shut down DR resources if no longer needed.

- Post-Mortem/Reporting – Document learnings, update runbooks.

- Tools Involved
- DNS: Route53, Cloudflare, etc.

- Replication: rsync, DRBD, cloud sync tools.

- Backup: Veeam, Commvault.

- Monitoring: ELK, Prometheus, Grafana.

- Automation: Ansible, scripts, Runbooks.
