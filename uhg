Explain about the current application, How did you developed cicd pipeline for..?
- Ours is the backend is a dot net application front end is a node js application 
- Our jenkins pipleine has build agent
- it ha svarious stages and steps such as build test deploy, we have post build actions sucess and failure, her ethe stages and steps consist of different repositories
- we have the docker hub registeris, aws ecr registeries and we have sonar qube and the nexus artifactory
- Nexus artifactory and aws ecr for pre prod
- for production we have Docker hub and Nexus artifactory
- Push and pull of the images happen through CICD pipeline and apart from the Sonar Qube and App scan is integrated with that 
- Kubernetes cluster details which is installed through helm chart and helm upgrade 
- Helm install is for resource deployment
- Helm upgrade is for there is an existing resources, there is an existing resource to upgrade that we use helm upgrade
- Apart from that security stand point will be using the trivy, clay
- Sonar Qube is checked to maintain the code quality the code is compiled and checked if 80 % code quality  check is been done
- Jenkins is tagged to git and git hub versioning its been done through web hooks and here we follow the multi branch pipeline dev prod pre prod hot fix and releas branch 

- When a deveoper pushes the code from feature branch, yu guys are mainiating if the code quality is less than 80 percent will  it merge into the develop branch code.
- Individual branches itself has sonar code quality check and if its going less than 80 percent there are alerts which is triggered and an notification email is sent to the
  team and so the code quality check is going less than 80 percent it wont be merged, if its satisfying the pre condition of 80 percent then only it goes to the PR apporval
  and to the main dev leads.
- If its having 80 percent quality check then only its getting meed to the dev branch.
- Until the review is approved only it wont merge.

- Your deploying to kubernetes cluster, from your jenkins how your kubernetes cluster is happening..?
