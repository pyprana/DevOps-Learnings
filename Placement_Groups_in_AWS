Placement Groups in AWS – 
- A Placement Group is a logical grouping of EC2 instances to control how they are placed on AWS hardware.

- Why:
 They're used to improve performance (like network throughput), reduce latency, or increase fault tolerance depending on workload needs.

- When:
You use them when your application demands high-speed communication between instances, low-latency performance, or resilience to hardware failure.

- Where:
They are applied within a single Availability Zone (Cluster & Spread) or across multiple partitions in one AZ (Partition).

Placement Groups in AWS :
Cluster Placement Group
- Used for: High-performance computing like Hadoop, Spark
- Benefit: Very low latency and high network throughput
- Note: All instances are placed close together in one Availability Zone.

Partition Placement Group.
- Used for: Distributed databases like Cassandra, HDFS
- Benefit: Fault isolation – one partition failure won’t impact others
- Note: Instances are grouped into isolated partitions on separate hardware.

Spread Placement Group
- Used for: Small critical services like DNS, web servers
- Benefit: High availability – each instance is placed on different hardware.
- Note: Best for a few critical instances, not suited for large numbers.

Note:
- Some instance types (like GPU instances) perform better with placement groups.
