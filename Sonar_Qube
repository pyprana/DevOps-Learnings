- In SonarQube, rules are defined to enforce coding standards and detect bugs, code smells, or security vulnerabilities.

- How to define rules in SonarQube:
1. Use built-in rules
- SonarQube comes with thousands of default rules for each language.

- Go to: Quality Profiles → Select language → Activate/Deactivate rules.

2. Customize existing rules
- Click on a rule → Click “Activate” or “Deactivate” → Use “Activate in…” to apply it to a profile.

- You can change severity or parameters of some rules (e.g., line length, cyclomatic complexity).

3. Create custom rules
- For Java: Use SonarQube Java Plugin API or XPath Rules for XML-based rules.

- For JavaScript/TypeScript: Write custom ESLint rules and integrate them.

- Generic way: Use external analyzers (like PMD, Checkstyle) and feed results via plugins.

4. Using Quality Profiles
- Create a custom profile → Add/modify rules → Assign to project.

- Profile is applied when the project is analyzed.

5. Rule templates (Advanced)
- Some languages allow rule templates (e.g., XPath for XML or Java rules).

- These can be cloned and customized.

- Here’s a step-by-step example of how to activate a rule in a Quality Profile in SonarQube (UI method):

✅ Example: Activate a rule in a Java Quality Profile
- Scenario:
- You want to enforce "Methods should not be too complex" rule in Java projects.

🧭 Steps in SonarQube UI:
- Login as an admin or a user with profile permissions.

- Go to “Quality Profiles” from the top menu.

- Click on the Java profile you want to modify (e.g., Sonar way or your custom one).

- Use the search box to find the rule:

- Example: search for cognitive complexity

- Rule: "Methods should not be too complex"

- Click the rule → Click “Activate” (if not already).

- (Optional) Click “Change severity” to set it (e.g., Minor, Major, Critical).

- (Optional) Set maximum complexity (e.g., 15) if the rule allows parameter changes.

🔁 To apply the profile to your project:
- Go to “Project Settings → Quality Profiles”.

- Assign your updated profile to the project for the Java language.
