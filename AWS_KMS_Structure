AWS KMS Structure

1. Key Types
 • AWS Managed Keys – Created, managed, and used by AWS services automatically.
 • Customer Managed Keys (CMK) – Created and controlled by you; customizable key policies.
 • Customer Master Keys (legacy term) – Now just referred to as KMS keys.


2. Key Components
 • Key ID & Alias – Unique identifier and friendly name for reference.
 • Key Material – Actual encryption data (can be AWS-generated or imported).
 • Key Policy – JSON-based IAM-style document that controls who can use or manage the key.
 • Grants – Temporary permissions to use a key without changing the policy.


3. Key States
 • Enabled – Ready for encryption/decryption.
 • Disabled – Temporarily inactive; can’t be used.
 • Pending Deletion – Scheduled for removal after retention period.

4. Key Usage
 • Encrypt / Decrypt – Secure data with symmetric/asymmetric keys.
 • Generate Data Key – For envelope encryption (small key encrypts large data).
 • Sign / Verify – For digital signatures (asymmetric keys).

5. Integration
 • Used by AWS Services – S3, EBS, RDS, Lambda, Secrets Manager, etc.
 • Audited via – AWS CloudTrail for full key usage tracking.

AWS KMS – Scenario-Based Use Cases
 • Encrypt S3 Data
Use KMS for server-side encryption (SSE-KMS) of sensitive files stored in S3.
Example: Store customer documents or logs securely.

 • EBS Volume Encryption
Use KMS to encrypt EC2 EBS volumes (boot/data).
Example: Protect data at rest on production EC2 instances.

 • Encrypt Lambda Environment Variables
KMS encrypts sensitive Lambda environment variables like DB credentials.
Example: Decryption happens securely at runtime.

 • RDS Encryption
Use KMS while creating an RDS instance to encrypt data, logs, and snapshots.
Example: Financial data in MySQL/PostgreSQL RDS.
 • Envelope Encryption for Large Files
Use KMS to generate a data key → encrypt large data with it.
Example: Encrypt application backup files before storing.

 • Cross-Account S3 Access with KMS
Share KMS-encrypted S3 objects between AWS accounts via KMS key policy.
Example: Central logging S3 bucket accessed by multiple accounts.

 • CI/CD Secrets Handling
Use KMS to encrypt secrets stored in AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
Example: Store GitHub token or database password in CodePipeline.

 • Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Compliance
Create and control your own keys with CMKs, enable audit via CloudTrail.
Example: Required for PCI-DSS or HIPAA workloads.

 • Encrypt Amazon EFS
Enable KMS encryption for Elastic File System storage.
Example: Secure file share for web application instances.

 • IoT Data Protection
Encrypt telemetry data from IoT devices using KMS.
Example: Smart home data securely sent to AWS backend.
