- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes. 
- With a single command, Docker Compose can create and start all the services defined in the configuration file.
- It is commonly used for development, testing, and staging environments. 
- A docker-compose.yml file defines the services that make up the application. 
- Each service definition specifies the image to use, any dependencies on other services, environment variables, ports to expose, and volumes to mount.
