- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes. 
- With a single command, Docker Compose can create and start all the services defined in the configuration file.
- It is commonly used for development, testing, and staging environments. 
- A docker-compose.yml file defines the services that make up the application. 
- Each service definition specifies the image to use, any dependencies on other services, environment variables, ports to expose, and volumes to mount.


version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - app
  app:
    image: python:3.9
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    command: python app.py

- In this example, there are two services: web and app. 
- The web service uses the nginx:latest image and maps port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container. 
- It also depends on the app service. 
- The app service uses the python:3.9 image, mounts the ./app directory on the host to the /app directory on the container, and runs the command python app.py.
- To start the application, run the following command in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file:

- docker compose up -d

- This command will create and start the web and app containers in detached mode. To stop the application, run the following command:

- docker compose down
