Nexus Repository Manager
- Nexus Repository (by Sonatype) is a tool that helps you store, manage, and share files like .jar, .war, .zip, Docker images, and more. 
- It supports formats like Maven, npm, Docker, and NuGet.

- What does it do?
- It acts like a central storage for all your build artifacts (files created after building your apps).

- Why use it?
- To organize, secure, and easily share your files across different teams and automate CI/CD pipelines.

- When do you use it?
- During build, test, and deploy stages.

- Example: After your app is built, the output files are stored in Nexus for others to use.

- Where is it used?
- You can set it up on your own servers (on-premises) or run it on cloud servers.

- How does it work?
- Developers or automation tools push files to Nexus.
- Nexus stores them safely.
- Other teams or applications download the files when needed.

- Example Flow:
nginx
Developer → Jenkins CI Build → Nexus Repository → Deployment Servers
 
- You build a Java app → You upload the .jar file to Nexus → Another team downloads it and deploys it in production!
