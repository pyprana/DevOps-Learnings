- Route 53
- Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available DNS (Domain Name System) web service by AWS.

- What is Route 53?
- A DNS service that:
- Translates domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses.
- Routes users to AWS resources (like EC2, ELB) or external websites.
- Acts as a domain registrar and health checker.

- Why use Route 53?
- High availability & low latency.

- Globally distributed DNS servers.

- Health checks to route traffic only to healthy endpoints.

- Integrated with AWS services.

- When to use it?
- Hosting a website or app.

- Need DNS-based routing or failover.

- Managing multi-region setups.

- Where is it used?
- With AWS services (EC2, S3, ELB, CloudFront).

- Hybrid and on-prem setups needing custom DNS.

- Public or private hosted zones.

- Key Features:
- DNS routing types: Simple, Failover, Latency, Geolocation, Weighted, Multi-Value

- Health checks: Monitor endpoints and reroute if down.

- Domain registration: Buy/manage domain names.

- Do we need a load balancer for Lambda or can Route 53 handle that?
- Lambda does not need a load balancer, as it auto-scales based on events.
- Route 53 is not a load balancer—it’s a DNS service.
- Use Route 53 to route traffic to Lambda via API Gateway, ALB, or regional endpoints.
- Private DNS for VPCs.

- How can I route traffic to different services based on the API path (e.g., shopping vs payment)?
- Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) with path-based routing:
- Route /shopping/* to shopping service target group
- Route /payment/* to payment service target group
- Alternatively, use API Gateway for microservices with stage-based routing or custom domains.
