- Side car means it will run beside the pod here in istio envoy is the pod that runs as a side car and enables the mtls encryption to the services that are defined in virtual 
  service the destination service and target service

- istio Envoy is a high-performance proxy developed in C++ to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh.

- The drawback of side cars is it consumes the resources like cpu and memory

- There will be like virtual service, destination rules using them we will do blue green and canary deployment
- So its acts as a secure connectivity between the kubernetes services
- We have dashboard tool kiali where we can see the traffic of the how the request moves

- Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to configure Istio in a Kubernetes environment:

1. Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.24+ recommended)

- kubectl installed

- istioctl CLI installed:

bash
- curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
- cd istio-*/bin
- export PATH=$PWD:$PATH

2. Install Istio Base & Control Plane
bash
- istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
- demo profile is for learning/testing. Use default or minimal for production.

- This sets up:

- Istio control plane (istiod)

- CRDs for gateways, virtual services, etc.

3. Enable Sidecar Injection
- bash
- kubectl label namespace <your-namespace> istio-injection=enabled
- This auto-injects Envoy sidecar proxy into pods in that namespace.

4. Deploy a Sample App
- Example using bookinfo:

- bash
- kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml

Verify pods:

- bash
- kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>

5. Expose the App via Istio Gateway
- Apply Gateway + VirtualService:

- bash
- kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
- Check the ingress IP:

- bash
- kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
- Then access:

- arduino
- http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/productpage

6. Configure Routing Policies (Optional)
Example: Split traffic between v1 and v2:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 50
7. (Optional) TLS & mTLS Policies
Enable mTLS for a namespace:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
EOF
8. Monitoring with Kiali, Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana
Install observability stack (demo profile includes it):

bash
Copy
Edit
istioctl dashboard kiali
This opens a UI to view traffic, health, and traces.

- CRDs like Gateways and VirtualServices in Istio are used to manage traffic routing within and to/from a service mesh.
- Gateways define how external traffic enters or leaves the mesh, while VirtualServices handle traffic routing rules within the mesh. 

- Gateways:
- A Gateway is a CRD that acts as an entry point for external traffic into the service mesh.
- It defines which ports, protocols, and hostnames the mesh will accept traffic on.
- Think of it as a load balancer or an edge point for the mesh. 

- VirtualServices:
- A VirtualService is a CRD that defines how traffic within the mesh is routed to different services. 
- It provides rules for routing traffic based on various criteria like URIs, headers, and other parameters. 
- VirtualServices can be used to route traffic based on specific protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP2, gRPC) and other conditions. 

- In essence:
- Gateways handle external traffic (north-south), defining how it enters the mesh. 
- VirtualServices manage internal traffic within the mesh (east-west), routing it based on defined rules.
