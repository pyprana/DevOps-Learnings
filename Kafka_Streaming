Kafka Streaming

What:
Experience with Apache Kafka Streams â€“ a client library for building real-time applications that process and analyze data stored in Kafka.
Why:
Used for event-driven architectures, stream processing, microservices communication, and real-time analytics.
When:
Ideal when working with continuous data flows, log aggregation, fraud detection, or monitoring systems.
Where:
Used in data pipelines, backend microservices, and edge systems to process data without storing it in external systems first.

Key Experience Areas:
Setup: Created Kafka producers/consumers with custom serialization (Avro/JSON).
Kafka Streams: Built stream processing apps using KStream, KTable, windowing, joins, and stateful processing.
Fault Tolerance: Managed exactly-once semantics, state stores with RocksDB.
Monitoring: Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for stream app metrics.
Deployment: Containerized stream apps using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes with Helm.

Example Use Case:
Real-time fraud detection system:
Ingest transaction logs via Kafka.
Apply rules in Kafka Streams (e.g., high frequency or high-value transactions).
Emit alerts to a downstream Kafka topic or Elasticsearch.
