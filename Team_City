Automated Building and Testing: TeamCity makes building, testing, and deploying software a breeze. Imagine it as a smart helper taking care of boring, time-consuming tasks. This automation is crucial because it means when developers make changes to the code, it gets automatically checked, tested, and added to the project. This way, we catch errors early on and make sure everything runs smoothly. So, TeamCity not only makes things easier but also keeps our software in tip-top shape.
Faster Development: With TeamCity, developers can see the results of their code changes quickly. This rapid feedback loop allows them to catch and fix issues early in the development process. It means developers can make changes and improvements without long delays.
Consistency and Reliability: TeamCity provides a standardized and consistent way to build and test code. This consistency ensures that every build and test process follows the same rules and procedures. When your software consistently passes these tests, it becomes more reliable.
Real-Time Monitoring: TeamCity offers real-time monitoring of the entire CI/CD pipeline. You can see the status of builds, tests, and deployments at a glance. This visibility helps in identifying bottlenecks and issues that need attention immediately. 
Cost and Time Savings: While setting up and configuring TeamCity may take some initial effort, it pays off in the long run. By automating many aspects of the development process, TeamCity saves time and reduces the risk of costly errors. It’s an investment that leads to cost savings and higher efficiency.
Scalability: TeamCity is designed to scale with your project. Whether you’re working on a small application or a large, complex software system, TeamCity can adapt. You can add more build agents to handle increased workloads, ensuring that your development process remains smooth even as your project grows.

How Does TeamCity Work?
TeamCity operates by keeping track of any alterations made to the source code stored in repositories. Once it identifies a change, TeamCity initiates a build process. This process involves assembling, testing, and packaging the software. Notably, TeamCity can carry out these tasks using various build agents, which are essentially machines devoted to overseeing these builds.

Upon completion of the build, TeamCity stores the resulting files, termed build artifacts, in a repository. These artifacts encompass elements like the compiled code, test results, and deployment packages.

Here is a simple example showing how TeamCity fits into a software development routine, in steps:

A developer modifies the source code and saves it in the repository.
TeamCity spots this change and starts the build.
The build runs on a designated build agent.
The build compiles the code, runs tests, and packs up the software.
If everything goes well, TeamCity stores the build artifacts.
A deployment tool takes over, putting the software into action in a real-world environment.
This whole cycle can be automated with TeamCity, making it so that the software gets built, tested, and deployed automatically whenever there’s a change in the source code.
