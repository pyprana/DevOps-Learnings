S3 Lifecycle:
- S3 Lifecycle is a set of rules to automatically move objects between storage classes or delete them after a certain period.
- To save costs by transitioning old or infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage or deleting unnecessary data.
- Use when you have data that becomes less valuable over time, like logs, backups, or archives.
- Applied at the bucket level or prefix level in Amazon S3.

- Example:
- Move files to S3 Glacier after 30 days.
- Delete files after 365 days.

- Key Actions:
- Transition: Move to another storage class (e.g., Standard â†’ Glacier).
- Expiration: Permanently delete objects.
