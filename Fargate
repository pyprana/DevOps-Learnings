1. Fargate Overview
What: Serverless compute engine for containers on ECS and EKS.

Why: Avoids managing EC2 instances; pay only for used resources.

When: Use when you want to run containers without provisioning infrastructure.

Where: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

How: Define container specs in ECS Task Definition or EKS PodSpec.

Example: Run a Python Flask app in Docker on ECS Fargate.

Use Case: Microservices, batch jobs, scheduled containers.

Difference: Unlike EC2 launch type, no server management.

Diagram: ECS → Fargate → Task → Container → VPC networking.

Production Use Case: Auto-scaled API backend using Fargate + ALB.

2. Fargate with ECS
What: Run container tasks directly via ECS using Fargate launch type.

Why: Simplifies container orchestration with minimal ops.

How:

Create a Task Definition.

Launch service with Fargate launch type.

Attach to VPC, subnets, security groups.

Example: ECS service with NGINX + sidecar logging container.

Production Use Case: Multi-container app with logging and metrics agents.

3. Fargate with EKS
What: Run Kubernetes pods using Fargate profiles.

Why: Run specific Kubernetes workloads serverlessly.

How:

Create a Fargate profile.

Match pods via labels/namespaces.

Fargate runs the pods matching the selector.

Example: EKS pod in “dev” namespace with Fargate profile.

Production Use Case: Development/test workloads on EKS with Fargate, saving infra cost.

4. Fargate Task Definition (ECS)
What: JSON/YAML describing container specs.

Why: Used to configure containers (CPU, memory, ports, images, etc.)

How: Define via console, CLI, or Terraform.

Example:

json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "name": "web",
    "image": "nginx",
    "cpu": 256,
    "memory": 512,
    "essential": true
  }]
}
