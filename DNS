- Understanding of networking concepts including DNS, TCP/IP, VPNs.

- DNS (Domain Name System)
- What: Converts human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (142.250.64.78).

- Why: Makes it easier for users to access websites without remembering IPs.

- Example: Typing www.amazon.com → DNS resolves it to its IP → browser connects.

- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
- What: Core protocol suite for communication on the internet.

- Why: Enables reliable data transmission between computers.

- TCP: Manages connection and ensures data is delivered (reliable).

- IP: Handles addressing and routing packets between source and destination.

- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- What: Secure tunnel between your device and a private network over the internet.

- Why: Encrypts your data, hides IP, and allows remote secure access.

- Use Case: Remote employees securely accessing internal company servers.
