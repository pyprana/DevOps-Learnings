- Rollback Strategies are techniques used to revert a system to a previous stable state when a new deployment fails or introduces issues. 
- Here are key rollback strategies in DevOps:

1. Manual Rollback
- What: Manually redeploy the previous version.
- When: Emergency or small-scale systems.
- Example: Reverting a previous build in Jenkins.
- Risk: Slow and error-prone.

2. Automated Rollback
- What: CI/CD pipelines detect failure and auto-rollback.
- When: Common in production environments.
- Tools: Jenkins, ArgoCD, Spinnaker.

ðŸŸ¢ 3. Blue-Green Deployment
- What: Two identical environments â€“ one live, one idle.
- Rollback: Route traffic back to the old version.
- Use Case: Web applications needing zero downtime.

ðŸŸ¡ 4. Canary Release
- What: Gradual rollout to a subset of users.
- Rollback: Stop rollout if issues found.
- Use Case: A/B testing, staged production deployment.

5. Feature Flags (Toggles)
- What: Enable/disable features without code changes.
- Rollback: Turn off the problematic feature.
- Tools: LaunchDarkly, Unleash.

6. Immutable Infrastructure
- What: Donâ€™t modify serversâ€”replace them with previous AMI or container image.
- Rollback: Launch older image.
- Use Case: Containerized and cloud-based apps.

7. Helm/Kubernetes Rollback
- What: Revert to a previous release using helm rollback or kubectl rollout undo.
- Use Case: Kubernetes-based microservices.
