🔁 Timeline of Events:
Time (IST)	Event Description
10:00 AM	Alert triggered from Prometheus
10:05 AM	On-call engineer notified via PagerDuty
10:10 AM	Initial investigation started
10:30 AM	Identified issue in DB connection pool
11:00 AM	Fix deployed
11:15 AM	Services restored

🧠 Root Cause:
Clearly describe the primary technical or human cause.
Example:
Database connection leak due to unclosed sessions in microservice X after a code deployment.

🧪 Contributing Factors:
Missing health check in CI pipeline

Inadequate alert granularity

No connection limit enforcement

🛠 Fix/Resolution:
Restarted service X to clear connections

Patched code to ensure proper session close

Scaled DB temporarily to manage traffic

✅ Preventive Actions (Bullet Format):
Implement automated health checks for DB session leaks.

Add connection pool metrics to Grafana for early detection.

Set alerts for threshold breach on active DB connections.

Introduce a regression test for DB session handling in CI.

Conduct internal knowledge sharing session on DB best practices.

Review and enforce coding standards for session/connection cleanup.
