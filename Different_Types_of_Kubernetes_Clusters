Different Types of Kubernetes Clusters 
- Single-Node Cluster: One node handles both control and workloads. (Best for Dev/Test)

- Multi-Node Cluster: Separate master and multiple workers. (Used in Production)

- On-Premises Cluster: Runs inside your own data center. (Private Cloud Setup)

- Cloud-Managed Cluster: Hosted by cloud providers like EKS, GKE, AKS. (Easy Scaling)

- Hybrid Cluster: Combines on-prem and cloud nodes. (Smooth Cloud Migration)

- Edge Cluster: Deployed near users/devices. (Ideal for IoT, Low Latency)

- Multi-Cluster Setup: Multiple clusters working together. (Disaster Recovery, High Availability)
